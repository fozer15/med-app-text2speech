I will be thinking of you!|you can do it!|Ah, gotcha. It's good to see that you tried and that you care that much. Most people are too lazy or scared to compete in things, myself included.

I'm super happy for you! I hope it goes exactly how you planned. You sound like a good father.|That is a really good idea. He must be thoughtful to have cooked dinner for you and had it ready, unlike mine|Yeah maybe that... they are also lazier.|Maybe you can call a neighbor or something to see if they see anything suspicious outside your house! Don't hesitate to call the police if you feel you should!|Oh my! I'm glad she apologized!|Yes at least there is that.  But it must be really scary to deal with someone willing to go that far.|That is awesome, what degree are you working towards?|Are you talking about the city or a person?|Sorry to hear that. Maybe you can talk with your boss about changing the schedule a bit.|Thats a great attitude to have. You should keep with that.|I understand being fascinated by them they can be very intriguing. Maybe you should stop watching as many though. |I've always liked the idea of meditation, but I feel like it'd be hard. My mind is always racing!|What a disgusting person. I'm just being honest.|Come on, the worst that can happen is that it kills you.|If I'm understanding you correctly, they're going to clean it up, right?|Oh goodness, glad you got through is safe lol|You must be over the moon happy.|That is really creepy, I would feel anxious too.

Sounds annoying|It is an excellent opportunity, to know other people and places, to open up to the possibility, I assure you that it will go to you very well|No, I never have. I've always lived in my state I was born in. However, I did travel to Utah which was about 1200 miles away and got a bit homesick so I can relate.|That is cool.  You are really so caring |Oh really?

I would just be happy and supportive of your friend and visit often!|I am not sure I would be able to forgive someone of something like that, it is really rude behavior.|That's great! I'm sure you'll be well prepared. |Have you thought about getting another dog? |yay! congrats! that's really awesome. you should be proud of yourself|There you go!

Instead, you are being a responsible person and doing what is best for your future.|I'm not sure. What would you do?|So where did you stop along the way?|That's really common actually.

My girlfriend, who is the smartest person I know, has had to make 5 duplicates of her car keys because she's locked herself out so much.

As long as you aren't hurting anyone, do whatever you please!|I'm so sorry.  You have my deepest condolences. Its hard to not feel isolation with the death of someone you are close to.  I can tell you it does get better and you are not alone.  He lives on in you.|Do you smack the women who do it?|I can't even imagine. I've never lost anyone super close to me yet...|What does what mean exactly?|I hope you are ok, what happened?|That's sweet|That's a great son. It's always nice to be able to rely on people close to you to help out when needed|Oh right, I am a doctor.|That is great, Why does he travel so much?|that is dangerous, glad that both of your are okay|Why?|Old school video games are full nostalgic memories for me.

No risk, no reward!|What kind of things do you like to do?|I can understand that.
